This library contains some algorithms and data structures that I've
developed for my own usage, because no free alternative with the
required features was available or had too many dependencies on
third party libraries.

Everything in this library is implemented in plain, portable C
and has no external dependencies. It can be used in other software
under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3
or any newer version.

* Algorithms:
  + Fowler–Noll–Vo hash function in 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and
    1024 bit variants.

* Data structures:
  + Skip list (TODO)
  + Bloom filter (TODO)
